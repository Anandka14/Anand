## Awareness of cyber security
        
           In the session he tolds lot of information about the cyber security how to handle the 
           network very carefully. as we are using the network widely we should be very carefull 
           while using them we dont want to go into the unwanted websites and get trapped.when we 
           go and downloads movies are someting for torrents there are many malcious file occured 
           they are get into our system and it slows down the system. so dont get trapped into it
           while using there are lots of pop up advertisment are seen in our screen when we touch 
           the link our system get fully affected by the malcious file. so when we are using the 
           interet source we should mostly avoid those things and he says some more valuable news
           about how to use the internet properly. we have to change our password once in every 
           three months and we dont have to keep the same password for the every application 
           the password must have all the requirements like one uppercase,lowercase,specialcharacter
           and number and thus the password must be strong.we want to clear the cache cookies 
           very frequenty,so that we can avoid some malciuos file entering into our system  at last 
           in the end of the day i have learned so many new things i didnt learned it before its  
           very usefull for me to keep my personal devices safer.
