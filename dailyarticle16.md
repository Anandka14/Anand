        Into the 16th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments,today i recalled with the yesterdays work
        in figma and my mentor came and told that i want to do code in html for the design i created in figma
        and then i started to working on that.i opened the terminal and start to type the html tags on it and then
        i started to change the background color what i used in the design then i used the div tag and separate it
        and give the white color as background for the login page and then tried to align the size correctly at position
        but unfortunately it takes more time to find the correct alignment for the design i tried with all the dimensions 
        to make correct of it at last i think i found the correct alignment and then i used the div tag to separate the 
        registration box and in this i used the background color as white in this division i named the class as reg for this
        div also it takes time to find the alignments and then i inserted the  image file into it and i tried to align properly 
        i change the margin, padding size to figure it out correctly but it dosent work then i asked to my mentor for the correction 
        and she saw my html codes and told the correction that padding size was exceede so that i cant align the image properly 
        then she explained me about to add the height features to the code.after she expalined it i got the clear idea of it
        then i went for the todays session.

## Todays session

        In the todays session koushik taughts about the algorithm importance, how to write the steps clearly to make the better
        solution for it, in todays session we are divided into three groups and each group has a task to perform, that we want 
        to create a algorithm for a robot to do the given task and returns to it original position and he gave us ten minutes to 
        write down the algorithm and we wrote it.and then he changed the algorithm notes between the three teams and to perform it
        it was very fun and interesting in the session when the task is going on and finally he told its how important to write the 
        steps of algorithm,and the algorithm must have to perform the output efficiently when we write a alogrithm we dont write it 
        for a single solution,we can wrote for the multifunction solution so it can be used in different ways.atlast at the end of 
        the day i learned so many new things in html and css and learned about in color segments,and about the alignments and in the 
        session i learned about the importance of the algorithm.
