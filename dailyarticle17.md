         Into the 17th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments,today i resumed with the yeterdays work 
         on creating the webpage for instagram login page.in the webpage i separated two rectangles for login and 
         registration and in the first rectangle frame i divided three rectangle frames into it and for each i want 
         to add the style propeties first i take the rectangle and named the class as user and start to add style properties
         i changed the background color by using the command i used the hex color code for it so i used the "#" before the code
         then i used the margin command to align the user box in a correct postion and used the the width command to increase 
         the size of the box.then used the border command to create the outile for the box i want a thin layer of border so i 
         used the the border-width-thin command for it and i get a actual size of the box then i changed the color of the border
         by using the border-radius command i changed the corner radius of the rectangle frame.for the second frame i named the
         class as pass and start to add the style properties to it and it is similar to the first frame so i easily aligned the 
         properties for it.for the third frame i changed the background color as per the design i used the opacity command for it
         to reduces the transparency of the color and i aligned the text into the center with the help of padding command after 
         aligned the box in the correct position,then i want to change the transparency of the text and i asked to my mentor she 
         tolds about the input command and i tried with that and finally i got the transparency of the text covered by border
         but i dont want the border around it i tried to remove the border by using diffrent command but i wont work for me 
         then i asked my mentor for the clear command for it she told me to search about the border outline properties and i
         searched and also i cant find the command and then she came and check my command and changed the border pixel and set the
         outline none and finally the the border is removed from the frame.


## Todays session

        In the todays session koushik taughts about the algorithm functioning.algorithm is a set of instruction given to computer 
        to performs  how the computer stores all the data in memory and processing and gives the output and these algorithm for 
        computers are done by humans.so when we give a instruction to the system it process depends upon the instruction,so its
        very important to give a correct input to the system else we dont get the output from the system,and he taughts with the 
        example by writing a set of instruction on the board and  to find how the the final answer would be displayed and we all 
        said our answers to him but it not the correct one, and then he wrote the answer how the actuall algorithm  function on it.    
        atlast at the end of the day i learned so many new things about how to create the webpage by using the html and css and i 
        learned lot of new commands and how it is used to the various operations in the session i learned about how the algorithm 
        working and processing in the system and the know about imporatance of giving instruction to the computers.
