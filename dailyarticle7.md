   Into the 7th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments,today my mentor asked me
   to see the topic about how the computer process from the start.before that i installed 
   git in my system and make some samples files to add into the gitsource.then i clearly 
   understand how to push the files.after that i goback to the todays topic i searched in 
   the google about that i got some reference and i learned from it before that i dont know 
   what process is going on. but after i learned the topic i got understand when we turn on 
   a computer the process happens called boot process. there are many stages in this process

## Five different stages in boot process

    -  BIOS
    -  Master Boot Record
    -  LINUX Loader GRUB
    -  LINUX Kernal
    -  INIT

   From these i learned many things in the first stage the process called  POST when the computer
   is turned a process which initializes the screen,keyboard,hardware and also tests the main memory
   in the second stage master boot record begins to find the operating system. for ex(window xp)
   in the third stage  Grand unified bootloader residing under boot in this stage a display of 
   splash screen is performed which allows the user to choose the operating system to boot in the 
   fourth stage LINUX kernal  immediately intializes and configure the computers memory along with
   all the hardware attched to the system.the kernel also loads some required application related
   to userspace.in the last stage init a run level is basically used to select the operating system
   the most important daemons is xserver daemon which manges keyboard,mouse,and display after
   completed my work i went for the session taken by koushik he taught about some interesting 
   topic in vim how to add some markdown comments in the file for that we want to create a file 
   .mdformat by creating this we can use some special comment which can be viewed in the git 
   he tolds us to practise in the session we all used the comments and tried and finally we came 
   know about how to use the special comments.and he said hereafter any assignment that given should
   be submitted in the following manner.atlast at the end of the day i learned many new things 
   especially about the special comment that he taught and about the git and how to push the files
   by using the git comments.
