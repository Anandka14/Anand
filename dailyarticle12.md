          Into the 12th of mentorship program in surfboard payments,today my mentor explained
          me about the topic "OBJECTS" in java script,And she explained clearly how the object
          is to be declared and what are the key should be used and how the final result implies 
          in the console,first when we assign a variable the data must be stored into a curly bracket
          then only it is considered as an object. into the brackect we can use keyword and store 
          multiple values,and we can call the values in console by using "DOT OPERATORS" and it can 
          be called by using the square bracket.after she taughts about the topic i practised for
          a while i taked my phone as the example and assign the values into the curly bracket the 
          name,color,model,etc.and i called the values by using the dot operator.after completing it 
          she asked me to see the OSI model.

## OSI Models

          Open system interconnection model describes seven layers that computer system use to 
          communicate over a network.And it has seven layers

          - Physical layer
          - Data link layer
          - Network layer
          - Transport layer
          - Session layer
          - Presentation layer
          - Application layer
        
          In the physical layer it deals about the connection between the network nodes, it connects devices
          and responsible for transmission of the raw data,in the data link layer it breaks up packets into 
          frames and sends them from source to destination,in the network layer it breaking up segments into 
          network packets and reassemble the packets on receiving end it uses IP to route packets to the 
          destination mode and in the transport layer it carries out flow control sending data at a rate that
          matches connection speed of receiving device end error cotrol,In the session layer it creates a 
          communication channels between the devices it also sets check points during data transfer.And in
          the presentation layer it prepares data for the application layer . It defines how two devices
          encode and encrypt and compress data so it can recieve correctly on the other end. Applicationn layer
          is used by end  user software such as web browsers and emails .It provides  protocols  that allows
          software to send and recieve information and present meaningful data to user.

# Hyper text transfer protocol
   
          After completed the osi model i learned about the http and how its works, http is used to communicate 
          between client and the web server by sending response and recieving response,http is a application layer 
          protocol for fetching resource such as html documents.


## Encryption Decryption 
    
           After completing the http i seen how the encryption and decryption works i refferd in browser and i learned 
           about it,Encryption means securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques along with a password 
           or key used to decrypt,And the decryption is the conversion of encrypted data into the its original form and there 
           are two types of keys and theybare symmetric and asymmetric,symmetric keys are same for both encryption and decryption
           and in asymmetric it has separate  keys for encryption and its called public key and for decyrption they use private 
           key,both the public and private keys are paired together.

## Todays session
     
           In the todays session koushik recalled the yesterdays topic proposition and how the truth table works to find whether
           the statement is true or false.And he talks about how to be an **IDEAL TEAM PLAYER** and he explained this with the 
           truth table he divided into three segments and wrote **humble,hungry,smart** one who has all the three qualities he 
           must be an ideal team player.if a person is very humble and he is not ready for learning  and disover new things and 
           not a good speaker in the society he must be a pawn like that he said, so the person wants to be achieve more he must 
           learn and want to speak his thoughts to the society so he can be good team player.he said for each and every words with
           example.Atlast at the end of the day i learned so many new things i learned the object topic in js and osi layers and about 
           http working and encryption decyrption.what i learned today is so much helpul for my future,and at the end i will try to 
           become an ideal team player by achieving the three qualities.
