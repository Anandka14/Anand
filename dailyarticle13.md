          Into the 13th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments,today i started recalling with the yesterdays 
          work transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol,then i went to the session

## Todays Session
    
          In the todays session koushik taughts about the propotional logic he gave five sentences to find whether it negotiating 
          or conjuction to the given three sentences and he explained about the topic.and then he wrote a puzzle to solve it and its
          about the four lands in water which is connected by seven bridges a person wants to go all the bridge and he must cross a 
          bridge for single time and he gave us time to solve the puzzle and we all tried with the different possiblities atlast 
          he came over and said there is no solution for the problem.and he taughts about the eulerian cycle it works when all the
          vertices are in even.and then he gave us another puzzle to do and it has twenty vertices if we start the point we want to
          complete all the twenty vertices without repeating it.and we all solved the puzzle.the he taughts about the algorithm.the 
          alogorithm is the set of intruction written by step by step to perform the task.the computers access the alogithm and performs 
          accordingly.

## About RSA algorithm
    
          After completed the session my mentor tolds me to see the topic about rsa algorthim and working and i reffered in the browser
          and learned about it.in the rsa method they uses two different key public and private key and in the algorithm they uses the
          key generation,key distribution,encryption and decryptionin in the first step we want to choose two large  prime numbers randomly
          and name it as "p and q" then calulate n with multiplying p and q and we want to find totient function for that we use this formula
          (p-1)(q-1)then we want to choose the number for e where 1<e<z this must satisfy.then caluculate d after that we got the public and 
          private keys pairs with this we can encrypt and decrypt the numbers or alphabets.

## HTML
   
         After completed the rsa algorithm my mentor asked me to see about the html and she send a video of it and i fully watched it and 
         reffered in the websites and started to learn about how to create websites and what are the tags are used for it first i learned 
         about them first we need a text editor to write the markup language and save the file and then we can viewed it by the browser 
         in HTML we uses tags < >wherever the tags are opened must me closed </> it has varites of tags once we understands clearly we can 
         create a pages with pictures, tables,and a document.in html it has a title,head and a body. the <title> tag which decribes the title
         of the document which is displays in the title bar,<head> tag defines the about the websites, ,<body> tag defines which we can write 
         all the content of the websites and other things,<h1> is the heading tag and it has upto <h6><p>tags are used to write the paragraphs
         of the websites and we can add links to the website by using <a href=>tag today i tried all those tags in vim text editor today.
         at the end of the day i learned so many new things and about html i learned a lot to use the tags properly.and about the rsa algorithm 
         i got an clear idea.
