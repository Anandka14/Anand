            tool. after created the account i started to using the tool and i know about how the different tools are working
            first i selected the frames which i wants to design to it.then i tried to find the tools and know about its uses
            then my mentor suddenly camed and asks if there is any doubts in yesterdays topic.then i told that i didnt understood

## CSS
     
            cascading style sheet it is used for to add styles to the HTML pages and to present the webage attractive,
            and my mentor tolds about there are three methods to add styles inline, internal and by linking the file
            inline method is nothing but we can add the style inside of the required tag that we want to change internal 
            method is we can create the class name for the reqiured paragraph and given the <div> tag we can add  styles 
            from it, the last method is we can create a separate file for styles and linking by the command in workfile.
            then she tolds how the padding ,margin and the border works and showed some examples for it and i learned 
            clearly about all the three  and i learn about the alignments, how to keep the page responsive  there are lots 
            of commands in css which helps for styling by using these all we can create a website. after completed the css
            topic my mentor asked me to design the username page in figma.
 

## Design in figma 
    
            I took instagram login page as model and i started to recreate the design by changing the color and other frames,text
            size, and i took a long time for finding the tools and to design for it, at the inial stage its hard to find the every single 
            tools used for it and then i created the frames for the username,password and for the login page then i changed the text size,color
            and created the first page without any logos on it.Atlast at the end of the day i learned so many new things and ne concepts 
            in css i learned a lot how to add styles to the html content by dividing them and how the alignment should be done and in figma 
            i started to design and i tried to know about the different tools uses.
