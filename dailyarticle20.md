        Into the 20th day of internship program in surfboard payments,today i started to learn about the loop condition in 
        javascript loop condition are used in javascript to perform repeated task based on a condition then i started to 
        learn about the loop condition in the for loop condition in a for Loop it is used to repeat a specific block of code
        a known number of times.in the for loop condition it has the syntax of intial expression,limit condition expression,
        incremental and decrement expression.in initialize expression if any is executed This expression usually initializes 
        one or more loop counters.The conditionExpression expression is evaluated If the value of conditionExpression is true and 
        the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates.after i learned about the for loop
        condition i tried in the console and declared variable and value for the condition to get the output first i tried to start 
        with the basic examples in the console to print heloo five times and declared the variable then i wrote the condition for it 
        and finally print in the console and i tried with the different examples and start to print the output for the numbers to print 
        in the loop and i asked my mentor for the explanation for the loop concept and she explained clearly about it how it works
        and what are  the various opertion we can do with the loop condtion and she tells about the condition that we want to terminate the
        loop where it end.


# Language 

       Today there is no session but we are divide into teams to create the language.on the previous session koushik tolds us to 
       create a language which has our own symbols,token and expression.and how the language has an valid expression and how the 
       expression start and end and we have to assign the  syntax rules for it and to assign the mathematical opertion symbols,
       and today we are divide into separate teams and discussed about how can we create a unique language and we all share our opinions 
       to create the language and we got some ideas when we are discussing and it also has lot more complex in it and we are trying to 
       reduce the complex of our ideas and to make better solution for it.
