         Into the 10th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments,after the weekend
         today my mentor asked me to see about the topic about java script.then i referred 
         in the google and searched about the basics of java script in the websites and i
         learned about the basics in that which help to the programming,first i learned 
         about what are varibles and how its used in js the variables are used to store datas
        
## Rules for constructing names for variables
  
    - Names can contain letters,digits,underscore and dollar sign
    - Names must begin with a letter
    - Names can also  begin with $ and _
    - Names are case sensitive (a,A) are different variables

## Java script data types
   
    - Numbers
    - Strings
    - Boolean
    - Undefined
    - Null
    - Symbol
    - Object
       
         In the java script we can store datas in the variables in which we can add 
         a datype in integer,a floating point value, an exponential value. Inthe string
         data type can be group of characters enclosed by a single or double quotes or 
         backticks.In the boolean data types has only two value true or false,it is used
         to check compare two variable to check condition.in the undefined the value has 
         not been assingned.In the null it represent the absence of any object.

 ## Operators 
    
    - Assignment operators
    - Comparison operators
    - Logical  operators
         
         After completing the operators topic i tried the varibles and data type in the console 
         in the website.while reffering into the google at the same time tried how to declare the                                                                                variable and how to assign the datas for it and i tried to add two integers and saw how 
         the output is executed then i assigns the different operators for it and executed the result
         from executing the datas i got some errors then i rectified it by analysing the mistake how its 
         happen what is wrong  in the data i searched some reference in google and i got some solutions
         from it and then i carify my mistakes.Atlast at the end of the day i learned some basics in 
         java script which is very usefull for the next level and its very interesting to learn some 
         new topics in programming.today i learned some basic in javascript how to assign the values 
         and how to add two numbers by using the operators.
