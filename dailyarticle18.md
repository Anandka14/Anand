           Into the 18th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments,today my mentor taughts about how the 
           java script is used in the html file and explained clearly about it,<script> tag is used to enable
           the interactivity of the website,in my webpage there is  a login box is occurred  and she changed the 
           login box into the button format,the button command is used to do a specifies the action when the button 
           is pressed.after the button command is used in the login box it is ready to do action then inside the script 
           tag we can give the function to display in the console and she showed the example by printing hello word into 
           it,after that she said to find me that  when the user name is filled with the text in the box and when we click  
           the button it must displayed in the console. and i tried to find in the browser and i tried in the html code 
           but it wont works and i replaced the command in different position but unfortunately my html code gets collapsed
           in the text editor and i really dont know what to do, then i started to rewrite the code with the help of class 
           i stared to figure it out every singnle class by one by one atlast i got the webpage, then i asked my mentor 
           how to add the name in user box and she explained about the input tag,when we add the id in the input tag 
           we can call it by the command document.getElementById when we use this the given id call and print in the console 
           and she tolds to do the same for the password section and i followed the method she used and i got the solution 
           after completing it my mentor ask me to see about the if condition used in the java script and i searched in the
           browser and knows about how it functioning, the"if" condition works when the statement is true,if the condition is false
           we can executed the output by another command called else.and she told to include the if condition to the webpage 
           
## What i learned today 
     
           Today i learned so many new commands in html and how the java script is functioning in the html how to add the 
           script into the html and about the if condition functioning,and very important thing that we want to push the code 
           into the git after we completed and we can easily restore the data.
