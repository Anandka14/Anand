      Into the 11th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments,today morning i recalled 
      the yesterday topic in java script about how to declare the variable and how to datas,and
      how the operators are working in it.then my mentor came and asked me to see the topic about
      arrays and how its functioning, then i reffered in the google about the arrays and saw the 
      explanation and then my mentor taughts about it and i get a clear explanation. after that 
      she tolds me to find how the least number is sorted in the array function without using any 
      function.and then i solve some examples which i know but unfortunately i didnt know how to 
      sort the array without using any functions.and then she told me to see the topuc about sorting

## Sorting
       
     In the sorting first seen the type merge sort, in the merge sort it actually works in the principle
     divide and breaks down the list into several sublist until the sublist consist of single element
     and merging those element to get a final results,then i derived the example and shows to my mentor
     after that i seen the quick sorting method, in the quick sorting it works by selecting the pivot
     element from the array and partioning the other elements into two sub arrays by seeing whether it is
     less than or greater than the pivot.after completing the quick sorting reference in browser i solved 
     the method by using some random numbers of my own and i got a clear idea of how the principle of sorting
     is occured then she asked to write an alogorithm for to find the least number in arrays before that 
     i studiesd about the pseudocode

## Pseudocode
    
     pseudocode is the way of programming which does not require any programming syntax.it is used to 
     rough draft for the program.then i started to write an algorithm to find the least number i wrote 
     an example and showed to my mentor which is not the correct method she said and explained clearly 
     after she taughts i gets a clear idea to write a algorithm and i wrote it. and she told me to write 
     the algorithm for to find the highest number.
 
## Todays session 
     
     In today session koushik taughts about the preposition logic with the some examples as well as 
     he told about how the statements is declared as truth one or a false statements, he says about the 
     conjuction in the statement and disconjunction in it, how the truth table works in a biconditional 
     statement,he wrote an example and explains how the truth table works in it,atlast at the end of the 
     day i learned so many new things in the array concept i learned much more today and its very interesting 
     to learn new things i got some clear idea how the numbers are sorting in the different manners, and at the 
     session i got some new topic to learn about the preposition logic and how to fine the correct statements.
