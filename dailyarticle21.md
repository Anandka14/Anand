      Into the 21th day of mentorship program in surfboard payments, today i recalled with the yesterdays topic loop condition 
      and tried in the console and my mentor asked me to find out the largest number in the array by using the loop condition and 
      then i declared the variables in the console and wrote the condition for it but i didnt get the answer and then i tried by changing 
      the condition then i got the output for the largest number and then i show it to my mentor and she said this method will started to loop 
      from 0 but we actually want to loop for those given numbers for the array then i tried with the method she told and get the output
      and she told me to find the smallest number in the array. then i went for the discussion with my team members about how to create the 
      language and we all shared our ideas but we dont have any idea to create the symbols for it but we had some ideas and we discussed about 
      it and how to create a new set of language with valid expression,tokens. after completing my discussion i started to tried the programming
      to find the smallest number in the array and i change the condition for it but i didnt get the output i got little confused with that then 
      i asked my mentor for the clarification and she explained about it then ill find the answer for it.


## Todays session 
    
      In the todays session koushik tolds us to share our ideas and formation of the language according to the group and he tolds to write it on 
      the white board and then we dissucused our ideas and create some sort of symbols and we defines that our language are written in vertical position 
      then every team wrotes their ideas in the white board then he told that the english alphabet is not to used while creating the language 
      and then he explained about how to create a language with a proper readable and meaningful sentences would be and he told if the words are 
      written correct but the sentence has no meaning means the formation of the sentence must to change accordingly to the correct verbs and noun
      and he explained clearly about that then he tolds to create the langugue in a proper pattern. atlast at  the end of the day i learned so many 
      new things and about the loop condition  and  its very interesting to learn and also our team discussed about creating the langugage and its 
      helps to think our ideas.
